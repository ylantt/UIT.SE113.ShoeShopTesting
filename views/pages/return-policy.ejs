                For example, in the state of New York, if a retailer does not
                provide a Return & Refund Policy, the retailer will be required
                to accept returns and give refunds for all merchandise returned
                within 30 days of purchase. If you wish to limit this in any
                way, you will need to create and post a Return Policy with your
                own custom terms

              <p>
                First,<b> you will be able to control your return terms.</b>
                If you don't post a Return Policy, some laws require you to
                provide a minimum timeframe to accept all returns.
              </p>
              <p>
                Secondly,
                <b
                  >you will gain the confidence of potential customers and
                  convert more sales.</b
                >
                Shoppers are far more likely to do business with companies that
                have and post a Return Policy.
